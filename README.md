# RLStockTrading

This project is to use Deep Q- Learning to decide whether to buy or sell a stock.

## Why Stock Trading?

Stock Trading is a driving factor in Supply and Demand Chain.
It decides the price movement of different commodities. 

It has a high impact on the inflation and deflation. 
Stock Trading affects different sectors like politics, finance, etc.

This project utilizes Reinforcement Learning to predict either to buy or sell a stock.

## Dataset

The Dataset is derived by using the API Alpha Vantage. This API returns Time Series Stock Data of the companies like Amazon, Google, Facebook and IBM.

## Approach


Deep Q-Learning

Double Deep Q-Learning

## Results

The results were successfully implemented for Deep Q-Learning and Double Q-Learning.

From the Baseline models there was a increase in model performance. The model performance was based on the training loss.
 
There was a 4% increase in Deep Q-Learning and 9% increasing in Double DQN.
